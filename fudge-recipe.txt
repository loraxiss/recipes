Ingredients:
- 8 oz semi-sweet chocolate chips (225g)
- 5 oz sweetened condensed milk (140g)
- 1 tablespoon unsalted butter (15g)

Optional:
- Assorted nuts and dried fruits
- Kosher salt
- Dark and white chocolate chips

Instructions
1. First, line a silicon mat or aluminum foil in a pan.
2. Then add 8 oz of semi-sweet chocolate chips, 1 tablespoon of unsalted butter,
   and 5 oz of sweetened condensed milk in a mixing bowl and melt over bain-marie,
   hot water bath. You can use a microwave oven if you want. Stir altogether
   delicately to prevent air bubbles in the fudge just until the mixture is well combined.
3. Pour the mixture over the silicon mat slowly. This is 3-ingredient chocolate
   fudge. Sprinkle with optional toppings.
4. Then cool it in the refrigerator until completely chilled and set. Then cut
   the fudge into small squares.
